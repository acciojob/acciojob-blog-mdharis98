        <p>
          We can say that optimization is one step further than the brute-force
          method of problem solving. However, that does not mean that
          optimization is always the best answer. In this article, we will
          discuss brute force, optimization, time complexity, and space
          complexity and compare these methods. We will also discuss how to
          bridge the gap between brute force and optimization. If you are a
          software developer and are puzzled about both of these methods, this
          article is for you.

          DSA or Competitive programming? What is better for you? Questions such
          as these often put you in a dilemma as a programmer in your graduate
          years. Usually, students face this confusion and thus keep wasting
          time without coming to a decision. However, you don't have to worry,
          as this article will cover all your doubts and help you make the right

          As a job seeker, you may wonder what is flexbox. CSS Flexbox is a
          layout model that allows elements within a container be aligned and
          distributed within the container. It provides a convenient way to lay
          out items in a row or column and allows the items to be resized
          dynamically to fill the available space. This makes Flexbox an
          excellent choice for creating responsive designs.
